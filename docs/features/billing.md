# Billing

## What it does

Stripe is the source of truth for a paying site's plan and status. A Stripe webhook keeps each tenant's `plan`, `status`, Stripe ids, promotion code, subscriber band and downgrade grace in step with its subscription, and sends the owner our own receipt for each paid invoice. Stripe's own customer emails stay off.

## Surfaces and routes

- `POST /api/stripe/webhook` (`apps/platform`) — public, outside the locale proxy. It verifies the `stripe-signature` header against `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` with the Stripe SDK on the raw body, refusing a missing or wrong signature with 400 and changing nothing. Either secret unset answers 500 and logs `billing.webhook_secret_missing`. A handler failure answers 500 (`billing.webhook_handler_failed`) so Stripe retries; everything else answers 200.

## Behaviour

- Handled events: `customer.subscription.created`, `.updated`, `.deleted`, `invoice.paid` and `invoice.payment_failed`. Each names a subscription (an invoice through `parent.subscription_details`); any other event, or an invoice outside a subscription, is answered 200 and ignored.
- The handler never trusts the event body for state: it re-reads the subscription from Stripe and derives the tenant's state from its current `status`, so a late or replayed event writes the subscription's present state, not a past one.
  - `active`, `trialing` → the subscribed plan, `ACTIVE`, and any downgrade grace ended (its start and the three grace-email stamps cleared).
  - `past_due` → the subscribed plan kept, `PAST_DUE`, following Stripe's retry schedule.
  - `canceled`, `unpaid`, `incomplete_expired` → `FREE`, `ACTIVE`, the band cleared and the downgrade grace started (an already-running grace keeps its start); the daily sweep ([tenant provisioning](./tenant-provisioning.md)) runs it from there. Cancelling at period end therefore drops the site to Free when Stripe ends the subscription.
  - `incomplete`, `paused` and anything else → nothing is written.
- The plan comes from the subscription items' Price lookup keys through `PLAN_PRICE_LOOKUP_KEYS` ([plans and entitlements](./plans-and-entitlements.md)): exactly one Starter or Growth plan Price, and at most one band Price, whose ceiling is stored in `subscriber_band_ceiling` (none → null, the included 1,000). The webhook never chooses a band; it records the one Stripe reports. An unknown or ambiguous set of Prices writes nothing and logs `billing.price_unknown`.
- The tenant is the one carrying the subscription's customer or subscription id (`getTenantIdByStripeIds`); with neither stored yet, the subscription's `metadata.tenantId`, which Checkout sets. Two tenants matching the two ids is logged (`billing.tenant_conflict`) and writes nothing; no tenant is logged (`billing.tenant_not_found`).
- Writes, in order: `setTenantPlan`, which leaves an archived or suspended site unchanged (logged `billing.tenant_not_writable`) and clears the Free-or-trial key on a move to a paid, running site; then `setTenantBilling` with the customer and subscription ids, the band, the grace fields, and the promotion code the subscription started with (a stored code is never replaced).
- `recordStripeEvent` runs only after those writes succeed, so a failed write leaves the event unrecorded and Stripe's retry is processed. An event already recorded is synced again (the subscription's current state, so the tenant does not change) but triggers no follow-up.
- Follow-ups run after the response, once per event: when the plan changed, `onTenantPlanChange` — the one step every plan change runs, operator or Stripe — which today emails the owner the plan-change notice; on `invoice.paid`, the receipt.
- The receipt (`buildOwnerReceiptEmail`, platform mail from `OWNER_EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` to the owner) re-reads the invoice and gives the amount paid in the invoice's currency, the payment date and the plan in the site's default language, with a link to the invoice PDF (the hosted invoice page when Stripe has no PDF). An invoice that charged nothing sends no receipt. With no sender address or owner it is skipped and logged (`billing.receipt_unconfigured`, `billing.receipt_owner_missing`); a failed send is logged (`billing.receipt_failed`) and never makes Stripe retry.
- No worker step yet: a move to Growth starts the template-layer run once #5714 adds the enqueue to `onTenantPlanChange`; until then a Stripe upgrade, like an operator's, adds no template sections. Stripe secrets never go to the worker.

## Configuration

- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (platform, `src/utils/stripe-env/stripe-env.ts`; required in production). The Stripe dashboard's webhook endpoint points at `https://<platform host>/api/stripe/webhook` and sends the five events above; Stripe's customer emails (receipts, failed-payment notices) are turned off there. Setting both is console work, human-gated.
- `OWNER_EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` and `RESEND_PLATFORM_API_KEY` for the receipt.
- Cost: one Stripe API read per handled event (two for `invoice.paid`), free; one Resend email per paid invoice.

## Entry points

- `apps/platform/src/app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts` — the route
- `apps/platform/src/server/billing/handle-stripe-event.ts` — `handleStripeEvent`
- `apps/platform/src/server/billing/sync-stripe-subscription.ts` — `syncStripeSubscription`
- `apps/platform/src/server/billing/send-payment-receipt.ts` — `sendPaymentReceipt`
- `apps/platform/src/server/tenants/on-tenant-plan-change.ts` — `onTenantPlanChange`

## Tests

- Platform: `route.test.ts` (signed with the Stripe SDK's test header), `handle-stripe-event.test.ts`, `sync-stripe-subscription.test.ts`, `resolve-stripe-tenant.test.ts`, `send-payment-receipt.test.ts`, `plan-from-price-keys.test.ts`, `tenant-state-from-subscription.test.ts`, `grace-billing-fields.test.ts`, `subscription-id-from-event.test.ts`.
- db: `set-tenant-plan.test.ts`, `get-tenant-id-by-stripe-ids.test.ts`, `record-stripe-event.test.ts`.
- Not covered by tests: test-mode events from the Stripe CLI moving a tenant through Growth, `PAST_DUE`, `ACTIVE` and Free — a manual check against the dev deployment.
